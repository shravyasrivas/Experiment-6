### Algorithms

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 1: Check Whether a Number is Positive, Negative or Zero

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept a number from the user.

Step 3: Check if the number is greater than zero.

Step 4: If true, print **"Positive number"**.

Step 5: Else if the number is less than zero, print **"Negative number"**.

Step 6: Otherwise, print **"Zero"**.

Step 7: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 2: Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept a number from the user.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by 2.

Step 4: If true, print **"Even number"**.

Step 5: Otherwise, print **"Odd number"**.

Step 6: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 3: Find the Greatest of Three Numbers

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept three numbers from the user

Step 3: Compare the first number with the other two numbers.(and)

Step 4: If the first number is greatest, print **"a is greater"**.

Step 5: Else if the second number is greatest, print **"b is greater"**.

Step 6: Otherwise, print **"c is greater"**.

Step 7: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 5: Find Average and Grade (Three Subjects)

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept marks of three subjects from the user.

Step 3: Calculate the average of the marks.

Step 4: Display the average marks.

Step 5: Determine and display the grade using conditional statements.

Step 6: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 6: Check Whether a Year is a Leap Year

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept a year from the user.

Step 3: Check leap year conditions using modulus operator.((yr % 4 == 0 and yr % 100 !=0) or (yr % 400==0))

Step 4: If conditions are satisfied, print **"Year is leap"**.

Step 5: Otherwise, print **"Year is not leap"**.

Step 6: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 7: Print the Next Date

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept date from the user in dd/mm/yyyy format.

Step 3: Separate day, month, and year using split

Step 4: Determine the number of days in the given month.

Step 5: Validate the entered date.

Step 6: Increment the date accordingly.

Step 7: Display the next date.

Step 8: Stop.

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept a character from the user.

Step 3: Check if the character belongs to the set of vowels using in 

Step 4: If true, print **"Vowel"**.

Step 5: Otherwise, print **"Consonant"**.

Step 6: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 9: Calculate Gross Salary

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept basic salary from the user.

Step 3: Calculate HRA and DA based on salary conditions.

Step 4: Calculate gross salary.

Step 5: Display the gross salary.

Step 6: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 10: Calculate Income Tax

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Accept annual income from the user.

Step 3: Apply income tax slabs using conditional statements.

Step 4: Calculate the total tax payable.

Step 5: Display the calculated tax.

Step 6: Stop.

### Theory

Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on conditions. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements allow the execution of specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

In this experiment, various decision-making programs were implemented using relational and logical operators to handle real-life scenarios such as grading systems, salary calculation, date validation, and tax computation.

---

### Conclusion

Through this experiment, the working and importance of conditional statements in Python were successfully studied. The experiment demonstrated how decision-making improves program flexibility and logic handling. Conditional statements are essential for implementing real-world applications in Python.
